a = int(input("Enter a: \n"))
b = int(input("Enter b: \n"))

#if a>b: print("a is bigger than b")                                          # Short hand of using if

print("a is bigger than b") if a>b else print ("b is bigger than a")         # Short hand of using if else

# We should not try and use shorthand unless it improves our code. Thi can help you however to understand redability of other people's code
